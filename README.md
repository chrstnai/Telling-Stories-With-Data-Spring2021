# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Spring-2021
Hi, this is Christina's portfolio page for Telling Stories With Data Spring 2021.

# About me
Hello! I'm Christina and my pronouns are she/her. I am a MA Design Candidate at Carnegie Mellon School of Design. I'm a visual designer who wants to improve on how to communicate clearly and holistically in my work. I studied Mathematics and English during undergrad but also took several art/design courses. From there, I could see design was present in many subjects and wanted to study it further. Because of my background, I am interested in data and how it can be portrayed and really help drive in a point. I hope to take these skills and work as a UX/UI Designer or a Product Designer in the future.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to combine design and data through visual graphics to become a better, more understandable designer. Because I don't have a traditional background in design, learning about fundamentals like color theory improves my visual work. I am also looking forward to becoming more familiar with coding websites such as GitHub!
