# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Spring-2021
Hi, this is Christina's portfolio page for Telling Stories With Data Spring 2021.

# About me
Hello! I'm Christina. I am a MA Design Candidate at Carnegie Mellon School of Design. I'm a visual designer who wants to improve on how to communicate visually,  and holistically in my work.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to combine design and data through visual graphics to become a better, more understandable designer. I also hope to learn a bit of code!
