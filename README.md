# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Spring-2021
Hi, this is Christina Ip's portfolio page for Telling Stories With Data Spring 2021.

# About me
Hello! I'm Christina Ip and my pronouns are she/her. I am a MA Design Candidate at Carnegie Mellon School of Design. I'm a visual designer who wants to improve on how to communicate clearly and holistically in my work. I studied Mathematics and English during undergrad but also took several art/design courses. From there, I could see design was present in many subjects and wanted to study it further. Because of my background, I am interested in data and how it can be portrayed and really help drive in a point. I hope to take these skills and work as a UX/UI Designer or a Product Designer in the future.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to combine design and data through visual graphics to become a better, more understandable designer. Because I don't have a traditional background in design, learning about fundamentals such as color or clarity to represent work helps me to improve as a designer. I am also looking forward to becoming more familiar with coding websites such as GitHub!

# King County Cumulative Case Counts (Feb 28 - April 12th)
For class 2/10, we went over how to make a graph on Flourish. The original data can be found here:

# General Government Debt (2/12/21) 
"General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance." (https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) 
The data below has been taken from OCED. To compare each listed country's debt from the years 1995-2018, we used flourish to create a graph for each country. Because there are so many variables, seperating each country into its own chart can help distinguish a few differences quickly without putting too much strain on the eyes. For example, you can see which country's debt is consistently rising or declining.
