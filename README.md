# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Spring-2021
Hi, this is Christina Ip's portfolio page for Telling Stories With Data Spring 2021.

# About me
Hello! I'm Christina Ip and my pronouns are she/her. I am a MA Design Candidate at Carnegie Mellon School of Design. I'm a visual designer who wants to improve on how to communicate clearly and holistically in my work. I studied Mathematics and English during undergrad but also took several art/design courses. From there, I could see design was present in many subjects and wanted to study it further. Because of my background, I am interested in data and how it can be portrayed and really help drive in a point. I hope to take these skills and work as a UX/UI Designer or a Product Designer in the future.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to combine design and data through visual graphics to become a better, more understandable designer. Because I don't have a traditional background in design, learning about fundamentals such as color or clarity to represent work helps me to improve as a designer. I am also looking forward to becoming more familiar with coding websites such as GitHub!

## Data Charts

# Government Spending on Pension Benefits by Country
For class 2/8, we briefly went over how to make a graph on Datawrapper. Here's mine.

# King County Cumulative Case Counts (Feb 28 - April 12th)
For class 2/10, we went over how to make a graph on Flourish. The original data can be found here:

# General Government Debt (2/12/21) 
For our assignment this week, we created a graph based on the genreal government debt varying coutry from country. "General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits." (https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) 

Here's data directly from OECD for general government debt in 2018.

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gIY" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6gIY" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018</a></iframe>

The data below has been taken from OCED. To compare each listed country's debt from the years 1995-2018, we used flourish to create a graph for each country. Because there are so many variables, separating each country into its own chart can help distinguish a few differences quickly without putting too much strain on the eyes. For example, you can see which country's debt is consistently rising or declining.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5283046"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Using this data again, I've created another similar chart but stacked the lines up instead. The reason I believe the "stacked" chart might be more appropriate because we are talking about debt. Additionally, I changed the color to red, becuse this associates with negative figures, which is what debt is referring to. As each government continues to spend more than it takes in, the debt rises which is depicted in certin countries. See the highlighted areas grow or decrease can feel more significant because our eyes are drawn to these areas. For example, Estonia feels a lot less concerning than Japan, who seems to continue rising each year. 
 
I continued to keep the countries separated to prevent overcrowding the graph. I felt like having each individual chart kept a clear visual that was pleasant in a group and stood strongly alone, if needed. Even if I had categorized the countries in their respective continents, I felt like some categories would just be too large. Therefore, I believe having a grid of stacked line charts would be the best way.
