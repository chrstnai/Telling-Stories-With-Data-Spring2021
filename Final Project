# Why this subject?
Since the beginning of COVID, hate crimes against Asian Americans have gone up tremendously and there has been little media coverage over this.
Much of the news regarding this subject is reported through social media website such as NextShark. Because this topic is not discussed very much, 
I would like to do my project on this.
