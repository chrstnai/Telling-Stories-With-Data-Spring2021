# The Rise of Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans

# Story
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are rapidly growing since the start of the COVID pandemic. 
As a reader, I want to know why they are rising so that I raise awareness on this topic and provide support to Asian commmunities.
My call to action is to provide resources to help these communities and raise awareness over thes situations.


# Why this subject? What do I want to tell?
Since the beginning of COVID, hate crimes against Asian Americans have gone up tremendously and there has been little media coverage over this.
Much of the news regarding this subject was first reported through popular media websites such as NextShark. Only a few significant stories involving 
death or exteremely injured victims were receiving more coverage on WSJ and NY Times. Much of these attacks are due to the rise of xenophobia and racism against Asians 
after the start of the COVID pandemic. With a former president and other politicians calling the virus, the Chinese Flu or the Wuhan Virus, 
this language had spread to general public and created a stigma against Asian Americans. This was also added to by popular news outlets like NY Times who would
use photos of Chinatown and Asian Americans as a header images when speaking about COVID, creating associations that were not necessary.
With these events, it created a sense of fear among Asian communities as agressions and violent behavior increased over the last year. Many of the attacks are directed to people who lack the power to fight back physically such as elderly and children. 
It's heartbreaking to see this uncovered by the media and I would share some of these stories outlets there is a lack of representation of Asians in the media.

I also want to provide resources to learn more and help out. Because this is not getting covered in media as often as it should, it's hard to find data on this 
subject and  places that people can go to for support. There are groups such as the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force or local Chinatown communities that are 
helping out by offering walks, protection and funds to those who need it.

I will be using Shorthand (for now) to develop my website and tell this story. I also will be trying to take my own photos for this project.

# Data/Reports to Work with
American Bar Report of NY;

UN Report;

NYPD 2020 Hate Crime Reports:

Number of Reports AAPI has received & More Reports:

With the data sets, I hope to use most of them to compare the rise in hate crimes from the last year. I will be using the NYPD Hate Crime reports to do most
of my comparisons. However, I will be starting off with how Asian hate crimes have risen 1900% would drive in the story, because this is the most striking information.

From the American Bar Report and UN Report, there is also information of what kind of violent crimes are occuring such as physical alteractions, name calling, shaming, 
and more. I would most likely use a circle graph here to display the variety of crimes that are happening.

Maority of my data will becoming from Stop AAPI Hate, an organization dedicated to spreading news on this subject and collecting reports on this subject.
Some of their reports are in specific areas like LA or Georgia, so I might try to use a comparison of locations that these crimes are happening in. 

Below are some sketches I will be adding.
