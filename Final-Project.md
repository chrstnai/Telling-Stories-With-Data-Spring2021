# The Rise of Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans

# Outline
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are rapidly growing since the start of the COVID pandemic. As a reader, I want to know why they are rising so that I raise awareness on this topic and provide support to Asian commmunities. My call to action is to provide resources to help these communities and raise awareness over thes situations.


# Why this subject? What do I want to tell? Project Structure
Since the beginning of COVID, hate crimes against Asian Americans have gone up tremendously and there has been little media coverage over this in comparison to the amount of crimes. Much of the news regarding this subject was first reported through popular media websites such as NextShark. Only a few significant stories involving death or extremely injured victims were receiving more coverage on media such as WSJ and NY Times. (Show data here of the crimes rising) Much of these attacks are due to the rise of xenophobia and racism against Asians after the start of the COVID pandemic. With a former president and other politicians calling the virus, the Chinese Flu or the Wuhan Virus, this language had spread to general public and created a stigma against Asian Americans. This xenophobia was also added to by popular news outlets like NY Times who would use photos of Chinatown and Asian Americans as header images when speaking about COVID and created associations that were unnecessary. (Here I would use refences to articles)

With these events, a sense of fear among Asian communities grew as agressive and violent behavior increased. Many of the attacks are directed to people who lack the power to fight back physically such as the elderly. Children and teenagers are also experiencing forms of racism in their schools and daily lives (Show youth data of number of reported slurs from AAPI) It's heartbreaking to see this uncovered by the media and I would like to share some of these stories.

I also want to provide resources to learn more and help out. Because this is not getting covered in media as often as it should, it's hard to find data on this subject and places that people can go to for support. There are groups such as the NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force or local Chinatown communities that are helping out by offering walks, protection and funds to those who need it. (Put resources at the end)

# Sketches
Below are some sketches I will be creating visualizations for.

![alt Text](2019x2020.jpg)
I think I'll start with this graph first to show the increase of crimes in comparison from 2019 to 2020. 
1900% is an increase that's pretty hard to visualize, so I think a comparison would would be start the story strong. I think maybe showing the increase through an animation would be effective. I would want to see the visual percentage like the size of a circle or dots growing 1900%.

![2nd](Trend.jpg)
I would also show a line graph comparison to show how the crimes rose in a span of a few months in 2020 as compared to 2019. The start of COVID in the US was in March and you should be to see the continued rise of crimes from there. Here, I think the media coverage is important because of how they started using Asian communities photos for their articles and how politicians kept using the name "Chinese Virus."  While this quick sketch only shows NY data, I would also show other places such as Georgia and LA as a comparison and also inform readers it is happening in multiple places.

There are all types of crimes happening from physical to verbal. While only a few of the stories are being shared online, they are mostly violent. I also want to include those like name-calling and online threats as well. I can also add reports of what Asian Americans children are being treated like in school.

![4th](Number.jpg)
I think showing the number of crimes would be significant in comparison to 1 person. I'm thinking of creating a visualization of 1700 human figures would show the sheer numbers of crimes/reports.

# Data/Reports to Work with

The below are the data sets and reports I found. 

From the American Bar Report and UN Report, there is information on what kind of violent crimes are occuring such as physical alteractions, name calling, shaming, and more. I would most likely use a circle graph here to display the variety of crimes that are happening. These reports will be used to show where these events are receiving coverage and also to show how it is happening all over the US.

UN Report;

The following NY 2020 Report has the recorded amount of arrests made in 2020 due to hate crime separated by bias. I hope to use this to show the number of crimes related to Asian Americans and how it has changed over the last year. 

NYPD Hate Crime Reports:

Majority of my data will becoming from Stop AAPI Hate, an organization dedicated to spreading news and collecting reports on this subject. Some of their reports are in specific areas like LA or Georgia, so I might try to use a comparison of locations that these crimes are happening in. There is also data on what kind of crimes are happening here (Similar to the bar report). I can split these up to focus on in general reports and also one for youths because its more of a sensitive topic.

# Method & Medium
I will be using Shorthand to develop my website and tell this story. I also will be trying to take my own photos for this project. The way I want to tell the story is first through the large quanities of numbers and get through the number of crimes that are happening. I will also be adding hyperlinks to stories that have been reported because there are so many.

To begin my story, I will first show the data like Berinato recommended. (Most likely the 1900% increase) From there, I will be describing some potential causes like the lack of attention in media and the xenophobia spread of politicians and other new sources. I can add in how these numbers are increasing in cities and places all over the United States. Here, I think most of the graphs and visuzaltions about hate crimes will lie.

Moving on, I think I can also give some history on Asian communities as well to give more insight to why this is not being covered. Here I can also touch a little bit on the Model Minority myth and also add some background on the percentage of the population Asians make up.

Finally to end, I want to include resources to help this cause like as AAPI and local non-profits in NY & LA. This would be my call-to-action area because I think there knowing all this information is helpful but also having resources to go to is vital. AAPI has numerous resources to go to for this.

# PART II 

# Wireframes, Storyboards, Moodboards

I decided to do most of my work on Figma. I kept my moodboard/persona nearby and created a wireframe of how I wanted my Shorthand website to look. My wireframe and storyboard will be included below but I'll also include the figma link:
https://www.figma.com/file/3NiMg0c6l1fbFF4nW32XvZ/Rise-of-Hate-Against-Asian-Americans?node-id=6%3A7

As I've mentioned before, my goal is to raise awareness on the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans and also provide some information on how crimes against Asian Americans are not new. However, because of COVID, these crimes have skyrocketed. A large percentage of them are extermely violent and even involve death. While these crimes are  especially shocking, other instances of everyday crimes and acts of discrimination are not as widely as known. Because most Asian Americans are aware of this situation, my audience is the general public. After working more on Part II, I want to also include a little more of an explanation on why this might be happening and how Asian Americans are perceived due to the Model Minority Myth. Additionally, I will be adding more resources such as websites and books.

![7th](moodboard.png)

For my moodboard, I collected photos from Unsplash and wanted evoke certain feelings such as fear and hope. I also looked at some other nonprofit websites for inspiratios and to see what kind of information they provide. The persona that I believe most of my audience will have, would be Americans who have heard on some ocassion of these crimes but not to the extent. With these two in mind, I started my wireframe.

![5th](wireframe.png)
![6th](Storyboard.png)

To start, my storyboard explains the process I thought the audience would go through starting with "What is this?", learning information and then statistics, and moving to "Why and How did this happen?"  Following from Part I, I decied to use a heat map to distribute the attacks across the US. The highest amount of crimes are located in the California and NY, where a large population is Asian American. Moving down, I provide from explanation on why this might be happening because of COVID and going into more detail with the data. Finally with my call to action, I provide non-profit links that supporting this cause and sources to go to if you need to report a hate crime.

# User Research & Interviews
For my user interview, I had certain people in mind to ask:
1. Someone who had experience in exploring topics like diversity, so I could raise awareness effectively and navigate a sensitive topic like this.
2. Someone in the design program who could help me more visually and tell me what I was missing from the wire frame.
3. A peer who was would be considered general public, being aware of this situation but not knowing too much about it. 

After hearing feedback from my user interviews, I thought a lot more about how to make this information resonate with my audience. Much of my feedback revolved around how to make this more personal besides inforgraphic. I had briefly mentioned to all of them that I did not want to use photos/videos of victims for privacy reasons but they all suggested ways of bypassing this such as using quotes from articles instead. Other ways I thought were notable were using color and type to draw more emotion.

From my second interview, someone had mentioned if there was overlap between the type of hate crime and reported location. I could try breaking down the location (such as Georgia, NYC) and then separating the crimes from there. They also mentioned how there wasn’t a time frame for the Model Minority Myth section as this has been around for many years.

While the call to action could just be non-profit resources, I thought there should be more than just places for donations. I asked for some suggestions and someone mentioned links to articles and books to learn more. 

# Changes I Will Be Initating
My main goal will be to make the site more personal and get people to be more invested. Without the headlines and photos, I don’t think I get the severity of the attacks across as much as news articles do. Instead, I’ll try to add quotes and numbers from articles and use color and type to create more emotion.

For more details, I will be adding a section for age group. This can also resonate more with people knowing that seniors and children are being attacked. I will also be exploring to data to see if there are any correlations between type and amount of crimes in the state/area.

Lastly, for my call to action, I will be adding resources besides nonprofit organizations such as books and websites. I think sources of information can definitely be helpful, as this was one of the main reasons I wanted to create this site - I didn’t have a go-to for information regarding Asian Hate Crimes.
